        I am a senior at GaTech, major in Industrial Engineering and dual degree at Emory in Applied Mathematics. For this project, I am in charge of the UI building for website and help other team members in data cleaning, etc. Before doing this project, I did not know the popularity of blockchain and that bitcoins are widely mentioned in daily conversations.

        I am a second year computer science undergrad at Georgia Tech. My threads are Intelligence and Theory. For this project, I did the time series forecasting on Bitcoin prices and also produced many of the graphs in the visualization, including number of mentions and sentiment towards various blockchains. I also helped with data collection and cleaning.
